# StayFlow

**One app for everything at your building.**

Residents book the pool and reserve dinner. The front desk knows who's arriving. Management sees the whole community at a glance.

## What is this?

Running a nice apartment building today still means a lot of phone calls, paper sign-in sheets, and sticky notes. Someone wants to book the pool — they call the front desk. A resident's guest is coming — the front desk has to remember to expect them. Management wants to know how busy the gym was last month — someone has to go dig through a spreadsheet.

**StayFlow puts all of that in one place.** It's a single app that looks and works differently depending on who's using it — residents get a booking app, front-desk staff get an operations tool, and management gets a dashboard. Everyone sees exactly what they need, nothing more.

It's a real, working product — not a mockup. Every booking, guest pass, and message is saved to a real database, and the whole thing is live on the internet right now.

## Why This Project

I built StayFlow to show what I can do end to end — not just write code, but design a product a real business could run on.

- **It's a real system, not a demo shell.** Every screen is backed by an actual PostgreSQL database — nothing here is hardcoded or faked for the screenshots.
- **Three different experiences, one codebase.** The same app looks completely different depending on whether you're a resident, staff, or an admin — with real permission rules underneath, not just hidden buttons.
- **Security was treated like it mattered.** Passwords are hashed, logins lock out after repeated failures, sessions can be revoked instantly, and every account can only see its own data — the way a real company handles real user accounts.
- **It's actually deployed.** This isn't running on my laptop — it's live, on a real domain, the way I'd ship it for a client.

In plain terms: a fast, modern website (React) talking to a proper backend server (Node + Express) that stores everything in a real database (PostgreSQL), all running live on a cloud host (Railway) — the same kind of stack used by production apps at real companies.
